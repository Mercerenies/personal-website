        I have yet to find a good, comprehensive reference of abstract algebra structures, so I decided to write
        one myself. Here, you'll find the various structures that are studied by algebraists and a brief
        description of what properties they require. This is NOT a reference for abstract algebra proofs or
        results; it is a library of definitions and relations between structures.

        <b>NOTE:</b> This reference is under construction, so you should expect to see changes over time. If you
        find any errors, feel free to <a href="../contact.php">get in touch with me</a>.

        There are two ways to browse this reference. You can view the full list of structures if you're looking
        for something specific, or, if you're just perusing, you can start from <i>Set</i> and build up a
        structure of your choice.
        <ul>
          <li><a href="map.php?struct=list">List</a></li>
          <li><a href="map.php?struct=set">Browse</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, this reference is typeset using the wonderful
        <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" target="new">
          MathJax</a>
        library, which allows you to embed TeX and several other mathematical typesetting languages directly
        into HTML. It's free to use and I highly recommend it if you're tackling any similar projects.
