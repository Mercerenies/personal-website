            My summer of 2017 was spent at the Center for Research in
            Extreme Scale Technologies (CREST) working on a program to
            perform hierarchical multipole methods. Through my time
            there, I developed abstraction layers and worked heavily
            on optimization and performance, the details of which can

            A computer science professor at TTU was kind enough to
            give me the opportunity to help write example programs for
            and edit parts of his textbook on discrete simulation,
            which will be published in the foreseeable future.

            One of my hobbies is learning new programming
            languages. My main languages are Haskell, Common Lisp, and
            Ruby, and I also have a great deal of experience in C++,
            JAVA, Python, Perl, and Javascript. As a result of this
            multilingualism, I can easily pick up new languages as
            needed.

            tutoring at the college level.

            As part of my high school's rigorous graduation
            requirements, I wrote a senior research thesis on the
            hyperoperations hierarchy, defended it before a council,
            and taught the concept to a classroom of sophomores. The
            thesis itself is unpublished but available upon request.

            A game project that I'm particularly proud of, as it
            required a great deal of serialization and consistent
            treatment of data structures in GML, a language with very
            little built-in support for such things. The game allowed
            the player to travel backward in time, meaning every
            in-game action needed to be reproducible perfectly as a
            consequence of the environment.
