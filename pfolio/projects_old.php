      This is a list of notable past experiences, organized by application to
      the workplace.
      <ul>
        <li><b><i>Problem Solving</i></b>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li><a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/loop-an-adventure-through-time/43414">
                <b>Loop: An Adventure Through Time</b></a> - A game project I'm
              particularly proud of, as it required a great deal of serialization
              and consistent treatment of data structures in GML, a language with
              very little built-in support for these constructs. The game allowed
              the player to travel backward in time, meaning every action need be
              reproducible.
            </li>
            <li><b>CSC 4240</b> - An optional artificial intelligence class centered around
              searching solution spaces and later creating learning machines.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Mercerenies/net-game">
                <b>The &quot;Net Game&quot;</b></a> - A unique AI/game project which
              dynamically generates game content based on real world data. This is
              and likely always will be a work-in-progress, as I'll constantly be
              finding new things to add to it.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b><i>Teamwork</i></b>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li><a href="http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=679964&p=4895776">
                <b>Stick and Stone</b></a> - A short game I wrote as part of a team for
              a 72-hour game jam. This ended up being the most aesthetically pleasing
              game I've worked on, as my partner is an excellent vector artist.
            </li>
            <li><b>CSC 3040</b> - A course in professionalism and ethics involving several
              group projects, such as a research project, a case study, and a tutorial
              presentation.</li>
            <li><b>CSC 2111/2121</b> - Lab courses in the standard TTU curriculum
              involving weekly group projects.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b><i>Modern Skills</i></b>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li><b>CSC 2110/2120</b> - Courses in data structures and object orientation,
              respectively. These courses allowed me to become intimately familiar with
              C++ and Java and the intricacies therein.</li>
            <li><b>CSC 4010</b> - An optional course in programming languages, which
              through practice gave me the ability to pick up new languages easily.</li>
            <li><b>DEEDS Textbook</b> - A project I helped a professor work on, which gave
              me quite a bit of experience with Visual Basic and allowed me to transition
              smoothly into .NET development later.</li>
            <li><b>Programming Languages</b> - I am familiar with many languages and like
              to pick up new ones as a hobby. My main languages are Haskell, Common Lisp,
              and Ruby.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b><i>Professional Experience</i></b>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li><b>DEEDS Textbook</b> - This research project allowed me to gain experience
              working with a team and with professionals who have been in the field
              for much longer than myself.</li>
            <li><b>Student Tutoring</b> - I work part-time as an on-campus student tutor,
              allowing me to develop my communication and teaching skills at a much
              deeper level.</li>
            <li><b>Functional Programming Club</b> - As the current president of this
              campus organization, I frequently present to the group concerning
              functional programming concepts and ideas.</li>
