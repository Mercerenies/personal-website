      I consider myself to be something of a programming language enthusiast, so
      this is a list of programming languages I consider to be valuable to learn.
      The top three tend to be my languages of choice unless I have a good reason
      to use something else for a project.
      <dl>
        <dt><a target="new" href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a></dt>
        <dd>Purely functional programming language with completely controlled side
          effects and a very powerful type system including type inference</dd>
        <dt><a target="new" href="http://common-lisp.net/">Common Lisp</a></dt>
        <dd>A modern revamp of the LISP language. Comes packaged with a modern
          object system while keeping all of the LISP magic of old</dd>
        <dt><a target="new" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a></dt>
        <dd>A much more natural modernization of Smalltalk-esque objects than
          is provided by the more mainstream languages of today</dd>
        <dt><a target="new" href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a></dt>
        <dd>The go-to language for text processing problems; known for its
          one-liners</dd>
        <dt><a target="new" href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a></dt>
        <dd>A web language that compiles to JavaScript but supports many
          functional programming features and boasts a much prettier syntax</dd>
        <dt><a target="new" href="http://iolanguage.org/">Io</a></dt>
        <dd>A very small embedded language that subscribes fully to a
          prototype-based object system</dd>
        <dt><a target="new" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a></dt>
        <dd>A popular scripting language that takes C-style classes and makes
          them sufficiently dynamic</dd>
        <dt><a target="new" href="http://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a></dt>
        <dd>JVM Language with a heavy emphasis on functional code and delivering
          a scripting-esque feel in a compiled language</dd>
        <dt><a target="new" href="http://www.jsoftware.com/">J</a></dt>
        <dd>An analytical language that aims to keep the APL ideology of incredibly
          terse yet meaningful code</dd>
      </dl>
      NB: While I do consider it to be valuable to know mainstream industry languages,
      they are excluded from this list as they are, from a language theory perspective,
      not as interesting as the languages listed here.
